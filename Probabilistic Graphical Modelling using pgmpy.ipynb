      "\n",
      "Machine learning is a scientific discipline that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs and using that to make predictions or decisions, rather than following strictly static program instructions. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) are an important method in the machine learning field. In this notebook, we will discuss how you can use pgmpy to understand and use them.\n",

      "1. We can try to find a function which can directly map an input value to it's class label.\n",
      "2. We can find the probability distributions over the variables and then use this distribution to answer queries about the new data point by conditioning it on the new data point."
